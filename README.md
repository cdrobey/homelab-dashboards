# Homelab Grafana Dashboards

These Grafana Dashboards provide the foundation for my monitoring activities throughout my home network.  The dashboards use a TIG stack to build a set of dashboards that support a pfSense firewall, Centos/Ubuntu, and Windows Systems.

* Network Summmary - pfSense Dashboard for monthly cap review (Comcast 1TB Limit)
* Linux Summary - Ubuntu and Centos system level review
* Windows Summary - Windows system level review for cpu, memory, network, and disk
* VMware Summary - a set of three dashboard (Cluster, ESX, and VMs.)
